# Routes
Routes is a routing library for OCaml that allows defining type safe routes, to dispatch a request to a
matching handler, based on path parameters in the input URI target.

The [Readme](https://github.com/anuragsoni/routes/blob/master/README.md) contains some examples of how to use this library.
