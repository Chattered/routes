* Static bench: Collection of random 157 routes. Runs 157 urls through the router in every run.
* Parse: Collection of routes from the Parse.com api
* Github: Collection of routes from the github API


Note: The benchmarks don't represent all routing situations.
Please run your own tests on the routes you are most likely to define.
